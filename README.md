# greasepencilfocus
Greasepencil focus addon for Blender

This project is still in development, but is already working

Required version of Blender :
- Blender 3.1 or newer

How to install :
- Select "code" and download as zip file on your computer
- In Blender top menu, Edit > Preferences > Add-ons, click on "Install" in the top bar
- Browse and select the "greasepencilfocus.zip" file
- Activate the addon with the checkbox. Your greasepencil layers are now saving automatically the brush and color settings
- Use crt + shift + F to invoke the popup. The shortcut can be changed in the Editt > Preferences > Add-ons panel

Current limitations :
- When creating a material from the traditional menu, the new material is not saved directly in the current layer. Click again on the current brush tool to auto-save it with the new material
- When renaming a layer, its settings are lost. Click again on the current brush tool to auto-save all settings
