This is the Greasepencil focus addon for Blender to help work faster with multiple GP objects and multiple layers with repeating actions

This project is still in development, but is already working.

## installation
Required version of Blender :
- Blender 3.1 or newer

Steps :
- Select "code" and download as zip file on your computer
- In Blender top menu, Edit > Preferences > Add-ons, click on "Install" in the top bar
- Browse and select the "greasepencilfocus.zip" file
- Activate the addon with the checkbox. Your greasepencil layers are now saving automatically the brush and color settings
- Use crt + shift + F to invoke the popup. The shortcut can be changed in the Editt > Preferences > Add-ons panel

## current limitations
- When creating a material from the traditional menu, the new material is not saved directly in the current layer. Click again on the current brush tool to auto-save it with the new material
- When renaming a layer, its settings are lost. Click again on the current brush tool to auto-save all settings
